# ♟️ Chess System in Java  
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A simple console-based chess game developed in Java, focused on practicing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

> This project was created as part of my Java learning journey, with a focus on clean architecture, modular design, and exception handling.

---

## 📌 Features

- Full chess game logic (valid moves, turn handling, check, checkmate, and promotion).
- User input via console.
- Display of captured pieces.
- Colored board using ANSI escape codes for a better terminal experience.
- Modular code with multiple layers: **UI**, **Game Logic**, **Board Control**, and **Domain Entities**.

---

## 🎯 Technologies & Concepts Used

- **Java (JDK 21)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
- **Custom exceptions** for better error handling.
- **Streams & Lambdas** (where applicable).
- **ANSI color codes** for better UI in terminal applications.
- **Clean separation of concerns** (e.g., `Program`, `UI`, `ChessMatch`, `ChessPiece`, etc).
